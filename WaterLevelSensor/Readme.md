### Here I've got a Water Level Sensor.

- The DHT11 sensor is an electronic device that outputs an analogue signal that indicates the approximate depth of water submersion
- It has a three pins, one for vcc, one for signal and another one for ground.
- This sensor contains 10 interlaced traces, five of which are power traces and fice are sense traces
- These traces are not connected but are bridged by water when submerged
- These traces are exposed parallel conductors, and act as a variable resistor a.k.a potentiometer whose resistance varies according to the level of water.
- The change in resistance corresponds to the distance from the top the sensor to the water level, this gives us a inversely porportional relationship, that means:
1.  The more water the sensor is inmersed in, results in better conductivity and result in a lower resistance.
2. The less water the sensor is inmersed in, results in poor conductivity and result in a much higher resistance.
