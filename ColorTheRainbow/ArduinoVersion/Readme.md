# Section 2

### Here I've got a Tri-Color LED and an Arduino UNO.

### Similar as the example that used a 9v battery.
- The first push button will be connected to a digital pin of the arduino and with that value and some coding I will turn on or off the red led.

- The second push button will be connected to a digital pin of the arduino and if the button is pressed I will read the value of the ldr.

- The ldr will be connected to an analog pin of the arduino so I can vary the amount of current that flows to the green led;

- The potentiometer will be connected to an analog pin of the arduino so I can vary the amount of current that flows to the blue led;
