### Here I've got a Tri-Color LED.

- The red channel will be connected to a push button to turn on the red LED when it's pressed.
- The green channel will be connected to a push button to turn on the red LED when it's pressed. and a light dependent reistor such that we can vary the amount of current flowing through the led.
- The blue channel should be connected to a 10K potentiometer such that we can vary the amount of current flowing through the led.
