### Don't make me wait

- Wire up an RC delayed switch with a transistor that keeps on a LED for 75 seconds.

## Instructions

- Place a transistor through the gap and place a LED with a 200ohm resistor in the collector side.
- Create a charging circuit that goes to the capacitors and to the transistor wht the button is pressed.
- Place the emmiter side of the transistor to ground.
- Place 2 capacitors of 470uF and 220uF in series so we get 150uF.
- 5RC = 5 x 100k ohm x 150uF = 75 seconds.

## Materials
- 1 470uF Capacitor
- 1 220uF Capacitor
- 1 NPN PN2222 BJT Transistor 
- 1 100K ohm Resistor
- 1 200 ohm Resistor
