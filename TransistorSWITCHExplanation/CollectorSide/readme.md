# Section 3

### Here I've got a bjt NPN PN2222 transistor.
### Collector Side of the transistor

- The base is connected to vcc with a 100k ohm resistor, this should provide the required voltage to turn on the transistor.
- the collector will be connected from vcc to a 200 ohm resistor and then to an led.
- the emitter is tied directly to ground.


- The voltage at the emitter side is 0v, so we will only have roughly 0.71v higher at the base.
- And we will drop much more voltage across the 100k resistor which means more base current and more current in the collector.
- The voltage meassured between the base and the emitter will be almost 0.713 A.
