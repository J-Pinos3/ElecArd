### The Cascade Fade Challenge

- The first LED fades out after 0.235 seconds.
- The second LED fades out after 0.735 seconds.
- The third LED fades out after 1.6 seconds.
- The fourth LED fades out after 2.35 seconds.
- When I press and hold the four buttons simultaneously, all LED will turn on and capacitors should charge.
- When I release the burrons each LED should fade out.
- It takes 5RC to fully charge or discharge an RC circuit.

## Instructions

- Place the positive terminal of the battery to the vcc rail in the breadboard.
- Place the negative terminal of the battery to the ground rail in the breadboard.
- Place 4 push buttons from vcc through the gap of the breadboard.
- place a 1k resistor in the ouput of the button.
- In parallel put the LED and (in Series or Parallel) the necessary capacitors.
- Tie the LED's and the capacitor to ground rail.
